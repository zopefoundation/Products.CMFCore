  <h3><code>portal_actions</code> Tool</h3>
  
  <p> This tool assembles the "actions" which are germane to the current
      user (anonymous, member, etc.) and context (content object or folder
      being viewed).  These actions are drawn from several optional sources:
  
    <ul>
      <li> the actions tool itself, for "global" actions;</li>
      <li> the workflow tool, for actions which depend on the
           workflow state of the content object;</li>
      <li> the membership tool, for actions which depend on the
           member or user;</li>
      <li> the types tool, for actions which are specific to a given
           content type;</li>
      <li> other action providers.</li>
    </ul>
  
  </p>
