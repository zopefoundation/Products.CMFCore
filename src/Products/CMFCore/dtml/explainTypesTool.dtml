    This tool manages the set of policies related to the content types
    which can be created on the CMF Site.  These policies include:
  
    <ul>
      <li> the construction mechanism; </li>
      <li> whether discussion is allowed for the type; </li>
      <li> what types can be added
           (significant only for "folderish" types); </li>
      <li> the "actions" which can be performed on objects of the type; </li>
    </ul>
