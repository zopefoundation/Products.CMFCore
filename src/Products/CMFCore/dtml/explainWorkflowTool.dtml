  <h3><code>portal_workflow</code> Tool</h3>
  
  <p>
    This tool associates objects of a given content type with a "workflow";
    workflows are "state machines", each representing the life cycle of a
    given family of content types, and specifying the "workflow actions"
    which are possible in any phase of the life cycle.
