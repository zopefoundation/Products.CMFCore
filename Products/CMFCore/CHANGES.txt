Products.CMFCore Changelog

  Products.CMFCore 2.2.0 (unreleased)

    - TypeInformation and TypesTool: Added support for add view actions.
      Type infos now have a new 'add_view_expr' property and implement IAction.
      'listActions' of the types tool includes type infos as 'add' actions if
      an add view URL is specified.

    - interfaces: Fixed some docstrings.
      There is no IActionInformation. ActionInformation is an old action class
      that implements IAction, non-persistent IActionInfo objects adapt action
      objects to a given context.

    - FSSTXMethod: Fixed Zope 2.12 compatibility.
      zope.structuredtext is now used instead of StructuredText.

    - removed the five.localsitemanager svn:external and its import hack
      in favor of stating the dependency for separate installation in
      DEPENDENCIES.txt and automatic installation in setup.py.

    - TypesTool: Refactored content creation.
      Moved addCreator call to IObjectCreatedEvent handler and moved
      notifyWorkflowCreated and indexObject calls to IObjectAddedEvent handler.
      Please make sure all oldstyle content factory methods use _setObject with
      suppress_events=True. CMF factory methods don't finish object creation,
      so they should not send the IObjectAddedEvent.

    - interfaces: Added new interfaces for CMFCatalogAware methods.
      In the long run ICatalogAware, IWorkflowAware and IOpaqueItemManager will
      become deprecated. Don't expect that CMF content always implements them.

    - setup handlers: All import and export steps are now registered globally.

    - MembershipTool: Removed ancient LoginManager compatibility code and
      deprecated the no longer needed __getPUS method.

    - interfaces: Removed deprecated oldstyle interfaces.
